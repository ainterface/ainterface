# Ainterface

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ainterface/ainterface.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ainterface/ainterface)

Ainterface provides APIs to communicate with Erlang processes, like [Jinterface](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/jinterface_users_guide.html).
And APIs of Ainterface are designed to integrate Akka with Erlang seamlessly.

## Notice

Since Ainterface is an experimental project, there is no guarantee that APIs will not be changed.
